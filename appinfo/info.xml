*Bring decentralized, sovereign cloud storage to Nextcloud with the HejBit Swarm plugin!*

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to configure HejBit Swarm in Nextcloud:

1. Ensure the **External Storage** plugin is enabled.
2. Install the **External Storage: HejBit Swarm** app from the Nextcloud App Store.
3. Navigate to External Storage Administration: Profile menu -> Settings -> External Storage.
4. Create a new external storage with a folder name of your choice and select *'HejBit-Swarm'* as the storage type. Then, enter the Access Key and URL configuration.

## Usage

Once installed, HejBit integrates Swarm directly with Nextcloud’s "Files" section, allowing seamless file operations:

- **Upload:** Transfer files to decentralized storage.
- **Download/View:** Retrieve and view files from decentralized storage.
- **Copy/Move:** Shift files between any external storage and decentralized storage.
- **Rename:** Change file names as needed.
- **Archive/Restore:** Manage your files by archiving or restoring them.
- **Hide/Show:** Control the visibility of files in your storage.
- **View Swarm Reference:** Access the unique Swarm reference for each file.
- **Export all Swarm References:** Backup all your Swarm references easily.

### Settings

Users with administrative credentials can configure the plugin through the standard External Storage settings. Here, you can input your Access Key and URL for HejBit.

### Using HejBit Swarm

Once setup and configured, the Decentralized Storage is ready to use.

- Access the Decentralized Storage folder under "All Files" or via the "Files" menu under "External Storage."
- Once uploaded, it can be viewed internally or downloaded. It can also be copied to another storage.
- Files from another Nextcloud storage can also be copied/moved to the decentralized storage. Choose the decentralized storage folder as the target Folder.
- To access a file's Swarm reference (its unique swarm network address), you have two options: right-click directly on the file and select the reference option, or use the three-dot Actions menu and choose 'View Swarm Reference.' Both methods will display the hash, which you can then copy to your clipboard for sharing or future access.
- To effectively organize your files, you can utilize the Archive and Restore features for both folders and individual files, allowing for better management of your storage.
- For a comprehensive backup of all your Swarm hashes, you can easily export all Swarm references directly from the menu located in the root HejBit Swarm folder.


### Additional Integration with Moodle

You can also enhance your experience by integrating the HejBit Swarm plugin with the **Moodle Nextcloud plugin**. This integration allows users to access decentralized storage directly within the Moodle environment, providing a seamless experience for educational content management. For more information on how to set up this integration, visit the [Moodle Nextcloud repository documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Nextcloud_repository).
